<h2>Building the plugins</h2>
<p>
A simple build script (build.sh) is provided in the scripts/build directory to compile the release.
</p>
<p>
Before using the build script, make sure that the FLEXPATH variable is set so that it correctly
points to the location of your flex 3 sdk install.
</p>
<p>
To build the release:
<pre>./build.sh</pre>
from the "scripts/build" directory.
</p>
<p>
Successful compilation will result in "ova-jw.swf" being created in the "release" directory and a copy of that swf will be placed into the "dist/swf" directory.
</p>
<b>A Note on Debugging</b>
<p>
We use Firebug - all debug output from the SWF will go to the Firebug console by default.
